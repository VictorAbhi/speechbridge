# Nepali Transcription Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added Nepali language transcription support with automatic language validation to the SpeechBridge audio transcription application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Frontend - Language Selector UI**
- âœ… Added a dropdown menu in the upload form (`/webapp/templates/index.html`)
- âœ… Options available:
  - ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English
  - ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ Nepali (à¤¨à¥‡à¤ªà¤¾à¤²à¥€)
- âœ… Added informational text: "The system will validate that the audio matches the selected language"
- âœ… Styled with proper CSS for consistent UI/UX
- âœ… JavaScript updated to send language parameter with form submission

### 2. **Backend - Language Support**
The backend already had full Nepali transcription support:
- âœ… Nepali ASR model: `amitpant7/Nepali-Automatic-Speech-Recognition`
- âœ… English ASR model: `BlueRaccoon/whisper-small-en`
- âœ… Language parameter handling in `/transcribe` endpoint
- âœ… Automatic language detection using `langdetect`

### 3. **Language Validation System**
The app includes automatic validation that:
- âœ… Transcribes the audio using the selected language model
- âœ… Detects the actual language from the transcribed text using `langdetect`
- âœ… Compares detected language with user's selection
- âœ… Shows friendly error message if mismatch is detected:
  - "You selected Nepali, but the audio appears to be in English. Please select the correct language."
  - "You selected English, but the audio appears to be in Nepali. Please select the correct language."

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
1. **`/app/webapp/templates/index.html`**
   - Added language dropdown form field
   - Added CSS styling for the dropdown
   - Updated JavaScript to include language in form submission
   - Updated feature card to mention "Multi-Language" support

### Existing Backend Support (No changes needed)
1. **`/app/webapp/app.py`**
   - Language parameter already handled (line 379)
   - Validation logic already in place (lines 257-266)
   
2. **`/app/webapp/transcription.py`**
   - Multi-language model support already implemented
   - Nepali model: `amitpant7/Nepali-Automatic-Speech-Recognition`
   - English model: `BlueRaccoon/whisper-small-en`

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User logs in to the dashboard
2. User selects an audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, AAC, WMA)
3. **User selects language from dropdown** (English or Nepali)
4. User clicks "Start Transcription"
5. System transcribes using the selected language model
6. System validates the transcription matches the selected language
7. If mismatch detected â†’ Error message shown
8. If match confirmed â†’ Transcription and summary displayed

### Language Detection Flow:
```
Audio Upload â†’ Transcription (Selected Language Model) 
            â†’ Text Output â†’ Language Detection (langdetect)
            â†’ Validation â†’ Success/Error
```

## Testing Status
- âœ… Flask app successfully started
- âœ… UI tested and verified working
- âœ… Language selector displays correctly
- âœ… Both English and Nepali options available
- âœ… Form submission includes language parameter

## Screenshots
Screenshots showing the implemented feature:
1. Login page
2. Dashboard with language selector visible
3. Language dropdown with English and Nepali options

## Dependencies
All required dependencies are in `/app/requirements.txt`:
- `langdetect` - For language detection
- `transformers` - For ASR models
- `torch` - For model inference
- `librosa` - For audio processing
- Other supporting libraries

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or your app URL)
2. Login or register
3. Upload an audio file
4. **Select the correct language** from the dropdown
5. Click "Start Transcription"
6. Wait for processing
7. View transcription and summary results

### For Developers:
- Flask app runs on port 5000 by default
- Start with: `python /app/webapp/app.py`
- Test user created: username=`testuser`, password=`test123`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add automatic language detection before transcription
- Add more language options
- Improve language detection accuracy
- Add language-specific summarization models

## Notes
- The language validation ensures users get accurate transcriptions
- If the wrong language is selected, users are prompted to choose the correct one
- This prevents confusion and improves user experience
- The system gracefully handles detection failures and continues processing
